#  Numerical Data Type and Inbuilt Method_Python

# x=5
# x is a variable that stores Integer data type


# price=26.25
# price is a variable that stores Float data type


# num=3e6 
# (3*10^6)
# num is a variable that stores a very big number (float)
# print(number)


# z=1+3j
# print(z)
# in real world we use i for Complex number, but in python we use j



# find data type using type() - it's similar to javaScript typeof() operator
# z=1+3j
# print(type(z))





# Inbuilt function to work with numbers

# print(abs(-5))
# abs will give me the absolute value

# print(pow(2, 3))
# pow will calculate power (2^3). pow takes 2 argument as input


# print(round(4.75))
# = 5
# print(round(4.5))
# = 4
# round will convert the Float number to nearest Integer



numbers = [3, 1, 5, 7]

print(min(numbers))
# min will give me the minimum number from a list
print(max(numbers))
# max will give me the maximum number from a list
print(sum(numbers))
# sum will calculate sum of a list
