# Controlling Loops (break & Continue)

# 1. break - will take you out of loop
# 2. continue - will skip just one particular iteration




# q. print 1-12. but stop when you find a number divisible by 4

# for num in range(1,13) :
#     if(num%4 == 0):
#         break
#     print(num)


# q. iterate 1-10. but only print a number if it is even
# for num in range(11):
#     if(num%2 !=0):
#         continue
#     print(num)
