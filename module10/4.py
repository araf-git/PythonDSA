# Nested Loops

# for i in range(10):
#     for j in range(5):
#         print('Hello World')
# for every i, j will print 5 times

# break and continue in nested loop
# break and continue always apply to the nearest(inner) loop

# for i in range(4):
#     for j in range (1,13):
#         if j%4==0:
#             break
#         print(j)
