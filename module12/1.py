# Function intro and its Syntax

# Function is a block of code which can be reused
# to define function in python, we use def keyword


def firstFuntion():
    print('Hello')

firstFuntion()





# Python
# indentation-based block structure.
# dont have bracket ({}) concept
# Same level of indentation = same block.
# Mixing tabs and spaces can cause errors 
# Forgetting to indent → IndentationError.

# Over-indenting/under-indenting → logic errors.

# Python’s indentation is mandatory, not optional—this keeps code universally consistent!
