# Return Types & Function Nesting


# Return Types
# def add_numbers(a : int,b : int)-> int :
#   return a+b

# print(add_numbers(5,7))
# print(add_numbers(5.5,7.7)) # but if you pass float instead of integer, it will also work. this is called implicit conversion




# Function Nesting
# def outer():
#   print("Hello from the outer")

#   def inner():
#     print("Hello from the inner")

#   return inner

# fn = outer()
# fn()
# outer()()
