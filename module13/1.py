# Intro to OOPs

# if i want to open a door, then i have to interact with the door.
# the door can have state and behaviour.
# in programming states are defined as attribute/field/property 
# in programming behaviour is defined as method.
# at first the door is in close state.
# if a call a method(defined inside the door), then the door opens, and door state is changed to open  
# these methods and states are internally defined inside the door
