# Time Complexity

# Data er sathe 2 ta jinish kori
# 1. Data Store korte chai
# 2. Data'r upor complex Computation/Algorithm chalai



# In the modern world
# the amount of data is huge
# so
# i want the storage to be effecient. kom space e beshi data store korte chai
# i want the computation to be super fast

# Data Structure ekhane help kore



# Data Structure
# 1. Structuring data so that storage become efficient
# 2. faster computation



# Data Structure is 2 types
# 1. Linear Data Structure
# 2. Non Linear Data Structure


# 1. Linear DS
#  - Storing Data in one dimension(linear) . example: array, linked list, queue, stack

# 2. Non Linear DS
#  - Storing Data in multiple dimension . example: Tree, PQ, Graph, Map/Dictionary


# Algorithm
# q. what is algorithm?
# ans: i have a problem and i want to solve it. the logical steps that i take to solve this problem is Algorithm
# a problem can have multiple solutions
# so to solve a problem, there can be multiple algorithm's
# some algorithm can be good, some may be bad.
# so i need to know which algorithm is better
# i need to analyze algorithm
# one of the tools that we use to analyze the algorithm is time complexity


# Time Complexity definition
# 1. should be independent of programming language
# 2. independent of operating system/processor

# Time Complexity definition
# How the number of operations are proportional to the input size
# no of operation = how many time the loop will run

# def func(n):
#     for i in range(n):
#         print('Hello')

# func(1)
# func(10)

# if n = 1, hello will be printed 1 times, operation = 1
# if n = 10, hello will be printed 10 times, operation = 10

# so no of operations proportional to n
# so TC = O(n) = Order of n (Big O Notation)


# TC have 3 case
# 1. best
# 2. average
# 3. worst

# TC = O(n) = Big O Notation is the worst case
# by TC we calculate the worst case. cause if my software performes good at worst case, it will automatically perform best at the best case


# Here are more time complexities to know:
# O(log n): Logarithmic time 
# O(n): Linear time 
# O(n log n): Log-linear time 
# O(nÂ²): Quadratic time 
# O(n!): Factorial time
